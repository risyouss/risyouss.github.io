## Work Experience
**Data scientist intern @ Singleverse soft (_Apr 2024 - 2024 Jun_)**
During this internship, I worked on an innovative project focused on interpreting brain signals (EEG) to generate machine commands using Deep Learning. My responsibilities included data preprocessing, designing the neural network architecture, selecting the optimizer and loss function, and defining the output layer. I was also involved in model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Projects
### Enhancing Early Detection of Renal Tumors with Semantic Segmentation

In this project, I developed an automated system for segmenting renal tumors in CT images using the UNet architecture. The goal was to accurately identify and segment tumors, helping in the early detection and staging of renal cancer. By leveraging deep learning techniques, I built a solution that enhances clinical decision-making by providing precise tumor segmentation, which can be used for further analysis and treatment planning. This project showcases my ability to apply advanced deep learning methods to medical image analysis for real-world healthcare applications.

### Real-Time Obstacle Detection and Recognition Using Deep Learning

In this project, I developed a real-time system for detecting and recognizing obstacles using deep learning techniques. The system was designed to accurately identify various obstacles, including university logos, in real-time. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), I created custom classes for object recognition and trained the model on relevant datasets to achieve high accuracy. This project demonstrates my ability to apply deep learning methods to real-world computer vision challenges, particularly in the context of real-time object detection and recognition.
## Minor projects
### Interactive Sales Data Dashboard with SQL ,Python and streamlit in Snowflake Notebook

I developed an interactive sales dashboard using Snowflake and Python, focused on the extraction, transformation, and analysis of sales data. I created dynamic visualizations using Python with libraries like Pandas and Streamlit. The dashboard showed key metrics such as monthly sales trends, performance by gender, and product category distribution. The project required skills in extracting, analyzing, and visualizing data—basically, seeing through the whole process of presenting complex data in a business insight-driven way.

### Netflix User Data Analysis [Details](https://github.com/risyouss/Netflix-User-Data-Analysis)<br>

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of 2,500 entries using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I explored user distribution by country and gender, revealing Spain's dominance in premium subscriptions and the USA's in basic plans. I uncovered trends in subscription types, device preferences, and audience demographics, with the average subscription lasting 10.78 months. By calculating total revenue, I identified the USA and Spain as top-performing regions. Visualizations, including maps and bar charts, showcased insights, emphasizing my ability to clean, analyze, and present data effectively.

### Exploratory data analysis of sales data [Details](https://github.com/risyouss/EDA_EcommerceDATA)<br>

In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 55,000 e-commerce transactions using Python tools like Pandas and Matplotlib. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I identified trends in customer behavior, such as the dominance of electronics as the most purchased category and credit cards as the preferred payment method. Insights revealed that customers aged 25-45 and female buyers were the largest demographics, with Mumbai leading in transaction frequency. This analysis highlights my ability to clean, analyze, and extract actionable insights from large datasets, supporting data-driven decision-making.

### British Airways Review Dashboard [Details](https://github.com/risyouss/British_airways_review)<br>

This project is an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to analyze customer reviews for British Airways. Using two datasets—one with country details and another with reviews—the dashboard provides insights into six key metrics (e.g., Overall Rating, Cabin Staff Service). It features filters for date, traveler type, seat type, aircraft, and continent, alongside visualizations like a map, line chart, and bar charts. Users can explore trends, geographical distributions, and aircraft-specific performance, enabling a comprehensive analysis of customer satisfaction.
