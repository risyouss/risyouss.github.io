## Work Experience
**Data scientist intern @ Singleverse soft (_Apr 2024 - 2024 Jun_)**
During this internship, I worked on an innovative project focused on interpreting brain signals (EEG) to generate machine commands using Deep Learning. My responsibilities included data preprocessing, designing the neural network architecture, selecting the optimizer and loss function, and defining the output layer. I was also involved in model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Academic Projects
### Semantic Segmentation of Kidneys and Tumors in 3D CT Images

In this project, I developed an automated system for segmenting kidneys and renal tumors in 3D CT images using the UNet architecture. By accurately delineating the kidney and tumor structures, this segmentation provides detailed anatomical information that can support the diagnosis and clinical assessment of renal diseases. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the system generates precise 3D segmentations that can be used for further analysis, treatment planning, and research applications. This project demonstrates my ability to apply advanced deep learning methods to complex medical image analysis for real-world healthcare scenarios.

### Real-Time Obstacle Detection and Recognition Using Deep Learning

In this project, I developed a real-time system for detecting and recognizing obstacles using deep learning techniques. The system was designed to accurately identify various obstacles, including university logos, in real-time. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), I created custom classes for object recognition and trained the model on relevant datasets to achieve high accuracy. This project demonstrates my ability to apply deep learning methods to real-world computer vision challenges, particularly in the context of real-time object detection and recognition.

## Personal Projects
### [British Airways Review Dashboard.](https://github.com/risyouss/British_airways_review)<br>

This project is an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to analyze customer reviews for British Airways. Using two datasets—one with country details and another with reviews—the dashboard provides insights into six key metrics (e.g., Overall Rating, Cabin Staff Service). It features filters for date, traveler type, seat type, aircraft, and continent, alongside visualizations like a map, line chart, and bar charts. Users can explore trends, geographical distributions, and aircraft-specific performance, enabling a comprehensive analysis of customer satisfaction.

## Extracurricular activities
- CoderSpace : As Vice President of CoderSpace, a club dedicated to empowering students with courses in algorithms and artificial intelligence, I lead sessions on machine learning and deep learning. I collaborate closely with our members on projects, fostering an environment of innovation and hands-on learning.

## Events
- **Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things Event** — *Event Responsable & Project Participant*  
  - **Event Role**: Managed the event organization, coordinated teammates, communicated with media partners, and wrote sponsoring requests.  
  - **Project Role**: Participated in developing two systems with a team of four:  
    1. **Object Recognition** — detecting items such as medicine or a bottle of water.  
    2. **Speech Recognition + Conversational AI** — converting speech to text, sending it to the ChatGPT API, and returning answers as audio for natural conversation.  
  - These systems demonstrate potential applications in **healthcare assistant robots**, capable of interacting with patients and managing smart environments around them.
